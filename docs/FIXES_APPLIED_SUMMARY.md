2. **Authentication Flow**
   - [ ] Login with user credentials (user@sc.com / 123)
   - [ ] Login with admin credentials (admin@sc.com / 123)
   - [ ] Login with operations credentials (operations@sc.com / 123)
   - [ ] Logout functionality works

3. **Protected Routes**
   - [ ] User cannot access admin routes
   - [ ] Admin cannot access user routes
   - [ ] Operations cannot access admin/user routes
   - [ ] Unauthenticated users redirect to login
   - [ ] Invalid URLs redirect to login

4. **Navigation**
   - [ ] Direct URL access works (e.g., /Admin/Dashboard)
   - [ ] Page refresh maintains state
   - [ ] Browser back/forward buttons work
   - [ ] All sidebar links work correctly

5. **ReportSearch Component**
   - [ ] Search component renders on User Dashboard
   - [ ] Search functionality works
   - [ ] Results display correctly
   - [ ] No errors in console

6. **Error Handling**

## üöÄ Deployment Checklist

Before deploying:

- [ ] Run `npm install` to ensure all dependencies are installed
- [ ] Run `npm start` to test in development mode
- [ ] Test all user roles (admin, user, operations)
- [ ] Test all protected routes
- [ ] Test error boundary by simulating an error
- [ ] Run `npm run build` to create production build
- [ ] Test production build locally
- [ ] Verify no console errors in production
- [ ] Check browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
