## Known Issues

### Potential Conflicts
1. **Dashboard.js naming conflict**
   - Admin dashboard: `src/admin/Dashboard.js`
   - User dashboard: `src/user/Dashboard.js`
   - Solution: Keep them separate in different folders, import with full path

2. **Sidebar component**
   - Current sidebar: `src/components/Sidebar.js` (for admin)
   - User sidebar: Different navigation items needed
   - Solution: Create role-based sidebar or separate sidebars

### Dependencies
- Bootstrap CSS is imported in multiple components
- Consider importing once in index.js or App.js for better performance

## Security Considerations

1. **Role-Based Access Control**
   - Implement authentication before accessing pages
   - Protect routes based on user roles
   - Validate user permissions on backend

2. **Data Validation**
   - Validate all user inputs
   - Sanitize data before API calls
   - Implement proper error handling

3. **Session Management**
   - Implement secure session handling
   - Add token-based authentication
   - Handle session expiration

---

## Performance Optimization

1. **Code Splitting**
   - Lazy load user pages
   - Split admin and user bundles
   - Reduce initial load time

2. **Asset Optimization**
   - Optimize images
   - Minify CSS and JS
   - Enable caching

---

## Conclusion

The user pages have been successfully integrated into the project structure. The next phase involves creating the login page and implementing role-based routing to connect all three user types (Admin, End User, and Ops) into a unified application.
