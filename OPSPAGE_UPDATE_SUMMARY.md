# Operations Page Update Summary

## Date: 2025-01-XX

## Changes Made

### 1. Fixed Import Path in OpsPage.js
**Issue**: The import path for `reports.json` was incorrect
- **Before**: `import reportsData from "../data/reports.json";`
- **After**: `import reportsData from "../../Data/reports.json";`

### 2. Added Bell Icon Notification Feature
**New Feature**: Integrated notification panel with bell icon to show pending reports

**Implementation Details**:
- Added `Notification` component import
- Added state management for notification panel: `isNotificationOpen`
- Created bell icon button with badge showing pending report count
- Bell icon displays in the header next to "Operations Dashboard" title
- Badge shows red notification count when there are pending reports
- Clicking bell icon toggles the notification panel
- Notification panel shows list of all pending reports with details

**UI Components Added**:
```jsx
<button className="btn btn-outline-primary position-relative">
  <i className="bi bi-bell-fill"></i>
  {pendingReports > 0 && (
    <span className="badge rounded-pill bg-danger">
      {pendingReports}
    </span>
  )}
</button>
<Notification
  reports={reports}
  isOpen={isNotificationOpen}
  onClose={() => setIsNotificationOpen(false)}
/>
```

### 3. Updated reports.json Structure
**New Attribute Added**: `group`
- Each report now includes a `group` field (e.g., "Sales", "Finance", "HR", "Marketing", "Inventory")
- This group field is used in the Transfer Logs table under the "Folder" column
- Helps categorize and organize reports by department/group

**Example**:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "name": "Sales Report Jan",
  "date": "2025-10-01",
  "group": "Sales"
}
```

### 4. Header Layout Update
**Before**: Centered title only
**After**: Flexbox layout with title on left and bell icon on right
- Title: "Operations Dashboard" (left-aligned)
- Bell Icon: Notification button with badge (right-aligned)
