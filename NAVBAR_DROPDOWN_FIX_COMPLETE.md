# Navbar Dropdown Logout Fix - Complete

## Issue Identified
The navbar dropdown menu for logout was not clickable on any page due to z-index stacking context issues. The dropdown was being rendered behind other page elements, making it impossible to interact with the logout button.

## Root Cause
- The navbar had `z-index: 1000`
- The dropdown menu inside the navbar did not have an explicit z-index
- The navbar-actions container also lacked proper z-index layering
- This caused the dropdown to be rendered behind other elements on the page

## Solution Implemented

### Changes Made to `src/components/Navbar/Navbar.css`

1. **Added z-index to navbar-actions container**:
   ```css
   .navbar-actions {
     position: relative;
     display: flex;
     align-items: center;
     z-index: 1001;  /* Added */
   }
   ```

2. **Added z-index to dropdown-menu**:
   ```css
   .dropdown-menu {
     right: 0;
     background: #ffffff;
     position: absolute;
     top: 60px;
     color: #003366;
     border-radius: 8px;
     width: 160px;
     box-shadow: 0px 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15);
     animation: fadeIn 0.3s ease;
     overflow: hidden;
     z-index: 1001;  /* Added */
   }
   ```

## Z-Index Hierarchy
```
Navbar:           z-index: 1000
Sidebar:          z-index: 999
Navbar Actions:   z-index: 1001
Dropdown Menu:    z-index: 1001
```

This ensures the dropdown menu appears above all other page elements.
